# Littus Bike Shop

Project live link (https://stored-bike-warehous.web.app)

- I used that material Ui to design this project.
- This is a project where a bike company has a number of bikes stored and how many have been sold.
- If a user wants to login here, he can add his items here
- This is a full stack project with both server side and client side, here the server side is used as a Mongodb database.
- I used React Router to move from one page to another
- Here I have used React Mouse Particle
- I use firebase hooks to make authentication easier
- I used jwt web token to secure api
- If a user goes to my items page then if his token expires then he has to login again.
- It has some futures left, they will come slowly, the work is going on
